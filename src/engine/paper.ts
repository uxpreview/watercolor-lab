/**
 * Paper.
 *
 * Everything distinctive about watercolor happens because the surface is not
 * flat: pigment settles into valleys (granulation), a starved brush touches
 * only the peaks (dry brush), and water runs downhill across the sheet's
 * texture. So the paper is a real height field, generated once per sheet and
 * read by almost every simulation pass.
 *
 * The field is fractal value noise for the felt texture, plus a faint
 * directional fiber component — cold-press paper is pressed against a felt,
 * and the felt has a grain. Hot press is the same recipe with the amplitude
 * turned down, rough with it turned up; the difference between papers really
 * is mostly amplitude.
