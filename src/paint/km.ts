 * Kubelka-Munk optics.
 *
 * Watercolor is not alpha blending. A wash is a turbid layer of pigment
 * particles in a dried gum film: light is absorbed (K) and scattered (S) on
 * the way down, reflects off the paper, and is absorbed and scattered again
 * on the way up. Kubelka-Munk solves that two-flux transport exactly for a
 * homogeneous layer, and it is why a glaze of ultramarine over burnt sienna
 * looks like a painting while `mix(blue, brown, 0.5)` looks like mud in a
 * paint program. This is the same model Curtis et al. used in
 * "Computer-Generated Watercolor" (SIGGRAPH 1997), applied per RGB channel.
 *
 * The formulas live here once, in TS for the palette swatches and the test
 * suite, and as a GLSL string (KM_GLSL below) for the render shader. The two
 * are written line-for-line against each other; the test suite pins the TS
 * side, and the GLSL side is a transcription kept adjacent so a change to one
 * is a diff touching both.

 * sets opacity: a cadmium hides the paper at S≈2, a quinacridone at S≈0.1
 * stays a glaze at any reasonable thickness.
 *
 * S is per-channel, weighted toward the channels the pigment reflects: real
 * pigments scatter selectively near their reflectance peak. With a flat S,
 * a thin wash is ruled by whichever channel is absorbed least and every blue
 * tints toward swimming-pool cyan while gaining chroma; weighting S by R∞
 * makes the backscatter carry the pigment's own hue, so tints walk toward
 * chalky paper-white along the pigment's hue line — which is what a real
 * cobalt or cerulean wash does. The per-channel K/S relation still holds
 * exactly, so the masstone round-trip in the test suite is untouched.
 *
 * `strength` is tinting strength: it scales K and S together, leaving the
 * masstone fixed while making a given concentration go further — how a
 * phthalo or an alizarin reaches a near-black masstone in heavy washes that
 * a weak pigment like terre verte never approaches.
 *
 * R∞ is clamped away from 0 and 1 because a literal 0 wants infinite
 * absorption and a literal 1 wants none, and real pigments are neither.
