/**
 * The pigment library.
 *
 * Every entry is a real pigment (or a traditional convenience mixture) with
 * its Colour Index code, and its behavior in the simulator comes from the
 * numbers a paint manufacturer would print on the tube:
 *
 * - `scattering` sets opacity. It is the absolute scale of S in Kubelka-Munk:
 *   high for cadmiums and earths that hide the paper, near zero for the
 *   quinacridones and phthalos that stay glazes forever.
 * - `strength` is tinting strength — how far a brush-load goes. The phthalos
 *   and alizarin overpower a wash at concentrations where terre verte barely
 *   tints; it scales K and S together so the masstone is unchanged.
 * - `granulation` is how eagerly particles settle into the paper's valleys.
 *   Ultramarine and cerulean granulate hard; the synthetic organics not at all.
 * - `staining` is the fraction of deposit that binds to the fibers and will
 *   not lift once it lands. Phthalo stains; cobalt violet wipes off.
 * - `density` is settling rate in suspension — heavy pigments drop out of
 *   moving water sooner, which is why an earth wash is calm where a dye wash
 *   keeps travelling.
 *
 * The masstone hex is the pigment at full strength; K and S are derived from
 * it once at module load (see kmFromMasstone), so a swatch, a wash, and a
 * glaze all agree because they all come from the same two curves. Masstones
 * are keyed deliberately dull — pigment on paper never reaches screen
 * saturation, and the deep transparents (alizarin, dioxazine, the phthalos)
 * are keyed near-black the way a real masstone reads in the pan.
